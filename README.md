# Project 1: Game Finder by Adam Larue, Sangki Jun, and Ian Mosur
## Description
This is the completed repository for the project 1 assignment by the UCF FSF Bootcamp. The purpose of the assignment was for the team to practice using two server-side APIs and the local storage together to render data on to a site. Video games and APIs concerning them were chosen as the topic of the project by the team's mutual hobby interests.
## Installations
N/A
## Usage
The first page of the site contains the search bar and a button where the user can input a game title and run the APIs. The two APIs connected to this site then fetches an image, description, platforms, genres, and a youtube video of the game title that is searched. The first API fetches the game image and data while the second one grabs the youtube video concerning that game title. All of the information is then rendered on the second results page.
